# hudson_solo_module

Contains `hudson_solo_module`, providing an interface and adapter that works alongside Hudson's SOLOSOFT application to automate a Hudson Solo Liquidhandler.

## Installation Notes


## Firewall

To interface with the module from another device, you'll need to [open up the port](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-open-port-windows-firewall) you intend to run the module's server on (2005 by default).
On most Windows devices, all incoming ports are blocked by the firewall by default.
